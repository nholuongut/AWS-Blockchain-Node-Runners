# Introduction

AWS Blockchain Node Runners is an open-source initiative aimed at simplifying the deployment of self-managed blockchain nodes. This initiative was kick-started by the AWS Solutions Architects with the goal of sharing deployment blueprints and infrastructure setups that can help address the common challenges faced by our customers running nodes on the AWS cloud.

Our journey began with research projects and testing conducted within AWS. As we delved deeper into this space, we realized the importance of making our work accessible to the broader blockchain community. We are happy to share our knowledge and expertise with everyone, encouraging open collaboration and contributions.

The AWS Solutions Architects involved in this project pour their hearts into it, all while juggling their primary job responsibilities. Their passion for blockchain technology drives them to provide the best possible support for this initiative. We're excited to have you on board and look forward to making the blockchain world more accessible together! ðŸ˜Š

We welcome contributions from both enthusiasts like us or established blockchain organizations, which many of our customers are. You can report bugs, create pull requests, add support for new nodes or new infrastructure configurations for existing ones. Please have a look at our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-blockchain-node-runners/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
