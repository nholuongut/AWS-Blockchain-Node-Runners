# Node Runners Blueprints

The Node Runner Blueprints are TypeScript applications built using the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). These blueprints implement the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) paradigm, allowing you to deploy your own blockchain nodes on AWS in various configurations, including solo nodes and highly available setups, for development, testing, or proof-of-concept purposes.

Most of the applications in the Node Runner Blueprints suite rely on an `.env` file located in the root directory to retrieve input parameters. These parameters determine the compute resources, storage options, and node setup configurations to be used during the deployment process.

## Adding new Node Runner Blueprints

First of all, THANK YOU! The easier it is to run a blockchain node on AWS the simpler it is for the ecosystem to build with it. Here are the major steps to contribute a Node Runner Blueprint:

1. Check with our list of [Issues](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-blockchain-node-runners/issues) if someone is already working on the node type you are after. If yes - join the forces! If no, go to the next step.
2. Create a new issue to propose a new node type to let everyone know that you are going ot work on it. Use `Feature request` template for that.
3. [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
4. Use one of the existing blueprints as a baseline. Choose the one that has architecture closest to the one you want to create.
5. Once you are happy with how your blueprint works, follow our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-blockchain-node-runners/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for our team to review it.
6. Once merged, let your community know that the new Node Runner Blueprint is ready for them to use!

### Reusable imports and CDK constructs for stacks in Node Runner Blueprints

- `lib/constructs/config.interface.ts` - Interface classes to implement your own configuration module. Compatible with `ha-rpc-nodes-with-alb` and `single-node` constructs (see below).
- `lib/constructs/constants.ts` - Useful constants to use in configuration files and to set up infrastructure.
- `lib/constructs/ha-rpc-nodes-with-alb.ts` - Provisions up to 4 identical EC2 instances to run nodes managed by an Auto Scaling Group and behind an Application Load Balancer.
- `lib/constructs/single-node.ts` - Creates a single EC2 instance to run a blockchain node.
- `lib/constructs/snapshots-bucket.ts` - Creates an S3 bucket to store a copy of blockchain node state to speed up syncing process.
- `lib/constructs/amb-ethereum-single-node.ts` - Creates a single Ethereum node with [Amazon Managed Blockchain Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/latest/ethereum-dev/ethereum-concepts.html).
